Setting Up the Development Environment","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#what-is-a-development-dev-container","title":"What is a Development (Dev) Container?","text":"<p>A dev container ensures that your development environment is consistent and works across different machines. At its core, a dev container is a preconfigured environment defined by a set of files, typically leveraging Docker to create isolated, consistent setups for development. Think of it as a \"mini computer\" inside your computer that includes everything you need to work on a specific project\u2014like the right programming language, tools, libraries, and dependencies.</p> <p>Why is this valuable? In the technology industry, teams often work on complex projects that require a specific set of tools and dependencies to function correctly. Without a dev container, each developer must manually set up their environment, leading to errors, wasted time, and inconsistencies. With a dev container, everyone works in an identical environment, reducing bugs caused by \"it works on my machine\" issues. It also simplifies onboarding new team members since they can start coding with just a few steps.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Step 1. Add Development Container Configuration","text":"<ol> <li>In VS Code, open the <code>go-tutorial</code> directory.

When you search for VSCode extensions on the marketplace, you will find the string identifier of each extension in its sidebar.
